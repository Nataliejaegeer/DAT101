    <h2>Collaborative Discussion</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Question 1: In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?
        <p>Answer: I think you could use one loop, but it is easier to use two loops. One for counting up and one for counting down.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Question 2: Can we create an infinite loop in the while condition?
        <p>Answer: Yes, if the condition is always true. For example, while(true) will never stop unless you use break inside.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Question 3: How fast does the computer guess, and can it do other tasks at the same time?
        <p>Answer: The computer guesses very fast. While it is guessing, it does not do other things. It waits until the loop finishes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Question 4: What is the relation between rows and columns in nested loops?
        <p>Answer: Usually the outer loop is rows and the inner loop is columns. You can switch them, but then the output order changes.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Individual Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Answer: I learned that loops are very useful for repeating things and making patterns. I also learned the difference between for, while and do loops. Nested loops make rows and columns easy. I understand now how to avoid endless loops.
