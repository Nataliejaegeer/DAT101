    <h2>Discussion / Answers</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>If wake-up time is not 7, nothing shows. If it is 7, the bus message prints.</p>

      <li>Same as question #1. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>If wake-up time is 7, I can take the bus. Otherwise I take the car.</p>

      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>If wake-up time is 8, I take the train. If it is 7, I take the bus. If it is less than 7 or greater than 8, I take the car.</p>

      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>Zero is neither positive nor negative. The code prints "Zero".</p>

      <li>Part 5: Extended number check</li>
      <p>The code now prints "Positive", "Negative" or "Zero" depending on the value of the number.</p>

      <li>Part 6: Photo upload</li>
      <p>If image is smaller than 4MP, it says "The image is too small". Otherwise it prints "Thank you".</p>

      <li>Part 7: Photo size limits</li>
      <p>Images smaller than 4MP are too small, images 6MP or larger are too big, otherwise it prints "Thank you".</p>

      <li>Part 8: Vitamin D check</li>
      <p>If the month name contains "r", it says "You must take vitamin D", else "You do not need to take vitamin D".</p>

      <li>Part 9: Days in month</li>
      <p>The code prints how many days each month has. February has 28, April, June, September, November have 30, others 31.</p>

      <li>Part 10: Gallery status</li>
      <p>The gallery is closed in March and May, open next door in April, and otherwise open normally.</p>
